The goal was to create a clean a personal website that was simple easy to navigate.

### Future Feature Updates
1. Activate the contact page to link to my email using JavaScript.
2. A Blog, a place where I can share as I learn and where I can post business tips.
3. Add featured blog post to homepage.
4. Add more projects that I complete in the future. :smile:

## Testing
The site was tested across chrome, firefox, and internet explorer on multiple device sizes.

and Youcompress to change the file size.
